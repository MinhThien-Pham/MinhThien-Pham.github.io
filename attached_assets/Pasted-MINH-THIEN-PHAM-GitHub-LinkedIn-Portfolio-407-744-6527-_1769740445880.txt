ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE
Freelance Software Engineer
Nail Bar & Spa of Saint Cloud | Saint Cloud, FL November 2025 – Present
• Engineered a local-first POS (Electron/React/TypeScript + SQLite) handling ~700 transactions/month and eliminating owner’s
manual payroll math through automated payroll calculations.
• Published 2 customer-facing web surfaces: a cloud-hosted promotional site and a LAN-based PWA for in-salon loyalty tracking
and QR-enabled gift card workflows.
• Established staff workflows (clock-in/out, turn/bonus/appointment queues) with role-based 4-digit PIN access
(Owner/Receptionist/Tech), supporting ~20 active staff.
• Architected conflict-detection UI to record multi-tech split payments, promo/reward application, and dynamic tip distribution,
reducing queue discrepancy issues during high-volume periods.
RELEVANT PROJECTS
Unix-like Shell (C) November 2025 – January 2026
• Programmed a Unix-like shell in C featuring an interactive REPL, native commands (cd/pwd/echo/type/history/exit), PATH
resolution, and process execution.
• Integrated pipelines (multi-command), 4 redirection modes (stdout/stderr overwrite + append), 3 quoting/escaping rules
(single/double/backslash), and persistent history (load/save) in a Unix-like C shell.
PL/0 Compiler & PM/0 Virtual Machine (C) August 2025 – December 2025
• Constructed an end-to-end PL/0 toolchain in C (hand-written lexer recursive-descent parser/code generator PM/0 stack VM) to
compile source programs into bytecode for execution.
• Designed lexical scoping (symbol table + static links) and control flow (procedures/if/while) with JPC/JMP backpatching,
targeting a 9-opcode PM/0 VM and enforcing lexer limits (11-char identifiers, 5-digit integers).
• Implemented a PM/0 virtual machine with PC/BP/SP registers, activation records, and instruction tracing to validate execution
and debug stack behavior.
GrubGo | Restaurant Ordering Web App (Team Project) (Node.js / Express / MongoDB / JWT) October 2025 – November 2025
• Co-developed a full-stack restaurant ordering app in a 4-person team using Git/GitHub.
• Delivered backend endpoints for registration/login with JWT, role-based admin access control, and cart/order workflows.
• Designed MongoDB collections and validation for users, carts, and orders; supported consistent JSON responses and error
handling.
Contact Manager | Full-Stack Web App (Team Project) (PHP / LAMP / Swagger) August 2025 – October 2025
• Authored authentication and contact CRUD REST endpoints for a PHP/MySQL contact manager web app within a 4-person
team project.
• Led a v2 refactor to centralize DB configurations and standardize JSON responses, improving code maintainability and
documenting endpoints via Swagger.
